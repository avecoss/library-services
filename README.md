#  Library Services

The Library Service is implemented using Spring MVC and JDBC Template. The application allows adding and removing books borrowed by readers, adding new books to the library, and options for deleting and editing books from the library. It also includes a straightforward reader profile creation with the ability to view currently borrowed books. The logic is implemented similarly to the library, where once a book is taken, it becomes unavailable for other readers. User profiles can also be edited or deleted.
